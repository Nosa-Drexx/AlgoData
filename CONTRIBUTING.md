# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to this documentation upderstandable and working. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

Create and issue or take up and open issue, 

And that's it!, create a new branch and Read the code available and change the part you don't like! Your change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you're adding a new algorithm or datastructure, start from the branch **main**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request to *Personal-Built-FunctionHelpers-and-DataStructure/main** branch for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Documentation

Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.
